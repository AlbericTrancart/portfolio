    subtitle: `It’s time for a first post! As an introduction, I would like to
              explain WHY I am doing this. This whole blog idea. This is a kind
              of meta-post that will serve as a guideline for the other ones,
              so let’s do this!`,

    subtitle: `One week ago, Elon Musk unveiled SpaceX’s plans to colonize Mars,
              starting in 2025. Yep, you read that right. A lot of friends keep
              asking me tons of questions about this whole project, but the most
              recurrent one – and the hardest to answer – is: why?`,

    title: 'How I Built My Lava Gaming Board In One Week',
    subtitle: `This summer as I had some free time I decided to build what my
              collection of minis missed: a decent-looking gaming board. Having
              already played with full-painted armies on great gaming boards, I
              knew that’s what I lacked to change cool battles into awesome battles.`,

    subtitle: `Last month I presented a talk @ HumanTalks Paris about CSS and
              what you can do to prevent it from being a chore. Having unreadable CSS
              files of thousands of lines is neither fun nor good for business.`,
