SpaceX Stats is the website I coded with stats about SpaceX's achievements. The original concept is not mine, it was first created by a Reddit user. I always wanted to promote the idea of space exploration but back then I lost faith in what we were able to do after the Columbia disaster and the retirement of the Space Shuttle.

However in April 2016 I randomly stumbled upon this video on YouTube and I was mindblown.:

Since then I followed all their highs and lows and when I learnt that the SpaceX Stats website was not maintained anymore I decided to recode the front-end with React, using [r/spacex's API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) to collect data about the launches.

I also added some charts and improved
the existing ones and the user experience on mobile over the original
website. You can also visit [the Github repository here](https://github.com/r-spacex/spacexstats-react).
