Last month I presented a talk at [HumanTalks Paris](https://twitter.com/humantalksparis) (and [ParisJS later on with more in-depth details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ztP8ujDkhI)) about all the CSS tools available, and how to decide which one to use or not.

_This talk is in French, however I have a [big blog post about CSS best practices and how to migrate a very complex CSS legacy app](https://blog.theodo.com/2018/06/write-better-css-part-1/)._
