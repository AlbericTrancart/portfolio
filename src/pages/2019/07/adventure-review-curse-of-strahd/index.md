_The Adventure Review is a series of blog posts I make mainly for my future self, a summary of the D&D modules I game mastered to put all those great memories into words. However if they can be useful to you too, it’s even better! ⚠️ **There are heavy spoilers ahead, you’ve been warned.**_

**The adventuring party:**

- Nyx Folkore (Mel), a gnome magician
- Selena, a human bard
- Darwin, a human Paladin
- Eskel, a human monk

**What we loved the most:**

- The Villain, with a capital V. What a character! Strahd is one of those bad guys your players will truly hate
- The setting, especially the Vistani and the Dark Powers
- The Tarokka card reading
- The town of Vallaki and all its subplots
- The Wizards of Wine, and the Keeper of the Feather
- The time pressure that I induced at the end of the campaign (they had 3 days to find the remaining 2 artifacts before Strahd's wedding with Ireena)
- The final fight with Strahd, from the top of Castle Ravenloft to the catacombs.

**The moments we'll always remember**

- The Monk dying at Vallaki's main square and coming back from the dead mere minutes later, with dark blood and a black spot in his eyes
- An encouter with Strahd with three duplicates of a the bard, bringing fear, distrust and pure chaos to the party. More details here: [The most terrorizing Strahd encounter I pulled off yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/atxv8w/the_most_terrorizing_strahd_encounter_i_pulled/).
- When a Dark Power called Darkness succeeded in turning our mage to the dark side. The others fought her in the Amber Temple to prevent this outcome, but she misty-stepped to break the Dark Power’s sarcophagus
- How animate object on 10 marbles covered in holy water can do 100HP of damage in one turn to a Vampire

**What was a bit less fun/didn’t stuck as a vivid memory:**

- The werewolf plotline

**What I learnt as a GM with this module:**

- How to milk external resources such as the [Curse of Strahd subreddit](reddit.com/r/curseofStrahd/) to get awesome new content, art and ideas!
- How to weave the PC's backstories into the main plot (thanks [Dice, Camera, Action!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1ZbgywIF6Y) for that)
- How to run a deep, complex villain
- How to craft some props for the players, such as this [bloodied letter prop](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/88i1fe/prepping_handouts_kolyan_indirovichs_letter_french/)

**Will I replay it in the future?**

I WANT TO. It was the best campaign I ever ran, and it has a lot of replay potential. It’s not a module I would run for first time players but otherwise I WANT to run it again.

**What whould I change?**

Incorporate even more stuff from Reddit/other sources. Run [the Interactive Tome of Strahd](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/301867/The-Interactive-Tome-of-Strahd). Use the [Into the Mists soundtrack from Travis Savoie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpRctqGTWw). But most of all: **make Strahd a female** (might do a post about it one about how it went if I come to it).

**The resources I used:**

- [Curse of Strahd subreddit](reddit.com/r/curseofStrahd/) (especially MandyMod's [Fleshing Out Curse of Strahd](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9pbka6/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_master_table_of/))
- [The Wedding at Ravenloft](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/249933/Curse-of-Strahd-The-Wedding-At-Ravenloft)
- [Wizard of Wines wine bottle labels](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/206975/Curse-of-Strahd-Wizard-of-Wines-Labels-Wine-Labels-for-Ravenloft)
- [Castle Ravenloft realistic maps](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/198960/Castle-Ravenloft--Realistic-Maps)
