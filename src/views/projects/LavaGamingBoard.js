        This project is one of my latest hand work projects. The goal was to
        design and build a decent-looking gaming board to wage awesome battles
        of minis. The challenge was that it had to be be cheaper than a retail
        gaming board and I had one week to do it.

        I love building things and this was no exception. It was very fun and
        rewarding: now I can play on it with friends and full painted armies and
        itâ€™s awesome. If you want to know how I did it,{" "}
