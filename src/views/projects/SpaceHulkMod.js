        Back in 2010, this was my first coding project ever: to create a total
        conversion mode based on the <em>Warhammer 40,000 - Dawn of War II</em>{" "}
        game in order to reproduce the gameplay and feeling of the{" "}
        <em>Space Hulk</em> board game.

      />

      <p>
        It was a big success because it made it to top #2 on ModDb (and still is
        #6,000 of #31,000 7 years later), was translated in 4 languages (french,
        english, italian and german) and it was featured in articles in several
        gaming magazines. The latest version was downloaded 20,000 times.

      <p>It featured and demanded:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>New gameplay and missions</li>
        <li>New models from other modders</li>
        <li>New maps</li>
        <li>Communication and promotion in forums and different websites</li>
        <li>LUA scripting</li>
        <li>Translation work</li>
        <li>Even the inclusion of a different soundtrack!</li>
      </ul>

        As a high school student it was an amazing project to work on and it was
        very rewarding. If you know the base game, here is a video of an in-dev
        multiplayer session that might interest you:
